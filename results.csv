Friendly, smiling, I even heard them call several customers by their first names, which shows those were returning customers, and that the staff cared to ask for their names and actually remember them. I even noticed some guests coming back in just to say bye and wish them a good day, that means a lot about the mood they've built up\n\nAbout the place, it has different sections, with some stools and a bench by the kitchen (convenient when waiting for your food to go to be served for instance), tables inside, and outside\nIt has nice decoration, with plants, nice lighting, and other nice touches\nNewspapers available too\n\nAnd the last but not the least, the fooood, and drinks, indeed\nLots of elaborated food options, with acai bowls, gourmet toasties, savory crepes, sweet crêpes, laksa etc\nFor drinks, hot coffee, iced coffee, chai, smoothies, milkshakes, cold pressed juices... For your hot drinks you can choose the type of milk, if lactose free, add some syrup...\n\nI personally started with an avai bowl, which featured, on top of acai indeed, pear, apple, banana, strawberries, muesli,  almonds, dried goji berries, pumpkin seeds\nThen a smoked salmon brie avocado crepe (for French people, this is not a galette, but like a giant blini in a crepe format, well worth trying)\nAnd to drink a mixed fruits one (apple, pear, orange, ginger and lime)\nIt was all appealing, yummy, healthy\n\nAn attention to details on all levels\n\nDefinitely the perfect place for brunch, once you'll have tired it, you'll want to come back, again and again\n\nHighly recommended!!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPIXY52dcZw1MPr3M8QaRQGEbT8J7CrQ_ANeJtP""],""When"":""2024-3-9""},{""Name"":""Dev Anggraini"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVkvMB8xcaMsTyPiesl12Kzzf8no0TjKsdAV73ydpsdO0o_N2o=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I forgot take picture of my food but I had to review this place because of the warmth and friendly service of the staff.

coffee and breakfast. Location is central, easy to find and access. Venue is neat, comfortable and open. Service was friendly. Coffee (mug cappuccino) was good, though a little less warm, though I could've asked for it to be hot (I prefer a hot coffee). Coffee art though was spectacular, if that is what your in to, which I am not so much. But it was pretty good. (I believe Duke's cafe was running an coffee artwork comp. So far this art was leading. IMO.) I also ordered the Yoghurt Parfait. I usually go for a more savoury breakfast, but felt like yoghurt. Unfortunately this option was greatly sweet. Fruit was nice, but soooo much jam and they use sweet yoghurt (as opposed to the preferred Greek yoghurt). I didn't really eat much at all. If you're a sweet tooth - go ahead.

Every Friday, the cafe morphs into a sanctuary for the local veteran community, offering not just free coffee, but an atmosphere of camaraderie where stories are shared.\n\nThe collectible fair run by the café is a quaint voyage into the past, offering a platform for enthusiasts to exchange and purchase unique treasures. As the holiday season approaches, Sam’s initiative to organize a 'Feed the Homeless' event reflects a deep-rooted empathy, creating a conduit for locals to contribute food and services, fostering a true sense of community.\n\nThe verdant charm Sam infuses into the café’s surroundings is a testament to his eye for beauty, making the space a verdant retreat amidst the urban hustle. Moreover, his recent election as a councilman for Darwin City Council showcases a level of trust and respect he has garnered among the locals.\n\nThe café itself is a delightful time capsule, with fascinating artifacts adorning every nook, inviting patrons on a nostalgic journey through time. The inclusion of a vegan menu was a pleasant surprise, offering a modern culinary touch to the otherwise vintage ambiance. Every aspect of the café, from its community-oriented services to its charming décor and diverse menu, resonates with the warmth and dedication Sam and his team bring into this beautiful venture, making each visit a unique, heartwarming experience.\n\nA definite must visit, and absolutely would recommend."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOxSXyAwokLx7s9GPaCCu1ox8KbyrWfTBkJbJiW""],""When"":""2023-10-30""},{""Name"":""Sera Koth"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKsFVeZUQt7zAuOwgOVjITA1cAf5XihTWLxbusdL1wPuYYFgw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Mad Snake has great atmosphere, coffee and food.

Ray’s Cafe and had an absolutely delightful experience. The coffee here is incredible, crafted by a very skilled barista. The pastry selection in the cabinets is impressive, and the menu boasts an extensive array of food options, ensuring there's something for everyone. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and attentive, which added to the warm and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe location itself is fantastic, offering both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor area is well air-conditioned, making it a perfect spot to relax on a hot day, while the outdoor seating is comfortably shaded and cool, ideal for enjoying the beautiful weather.\n\nI went to Ray’s for brunch and was blown away by the food. I tried a dish I wouldn't normally go for, and it was so delicious that I left nothing on my plate. The coffee complemented the meal perfectly. The ambience of the cafe is cozy and inviting, making it a place I will definitely return to soon.\n\nThe portions at Ray’s are generous, which is great for those with a hearty appetite. I particularly enjoyed their organic sourdough, which was springy and delicious, and the scrambled eggs, which were buttery and rich. The fresh juice was also a refreshing addition to my meal. The corn fritters, while a bit dense, were flavorful, and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection.\n\nOverall, Ray’s Cafe is a gem that offers amazing food, great coffee, and a charming atmosphere. Whether you're looking for a place to enjoy a quiet breakfast, a leisurely brunch, or a quick coffee break, Ray’s is definitely worth a visit. I highly recommend stopping by and experiencing it for yourself!\n\nAlex"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOsTBUrzHUXgCkxk6871eodFe9OjwwJizMnFEkb""],""When"":""2024-5-17""},{""Name"":""Otta Orsya"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL_TXUO8zl-SRak2g0x-HSA17jJsuh_r4bKk7XfnBwcijbRkc0=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Went to Ray’s for brunch and the food was amazing!

I visited for breakfast, hoping to find somewhere air conditioned and with good coffee. The coffee was good, but the air conditioning left a lot to be desired. The menu has a lot of options, but even cold meals like granola are a little on the expensive side, perhaps due to including a panacotta. Granola over $20 is not in the 'affordable' range. There is no table ordering, so you line up to order and pay (which is fine). The inside table and chairs were very flimsy/rudimentary, going for a varnished plyboard look. That'd be fine, except every time I tried to cut my meal (ricotta toast) with a knife and fork shook the table and almost spilled the coffee. My ricotta toast had a good covering of ricotta, fresh fruit and a drizzle of honey. It was good with the exception that the actual toast was more like bread than crunchy toast.\n\nOverall, Ray's cafe is fine. Darwin is blessed with lots of cafes and coffee stops, so try what's local to you.

There was no sauce served with the chips, maybe im just silly and should of ordered extra, but I kind of just assumed there would be sauce added to the side already like they do in other places.

From their delectable dumplings and succulent pork bao to their flavorful salmon noodles vermicelli and refreshing chicken salad, each dish is expertly prepared with just the right amount of spice to suit all palates.\n\nIn addition to dining in, I have also availed their services through Doordash on numerous occasions, and they have consistently delivered exceptional meals right to my doorstep.\n\nOverall, Misschu is more than just a restaurant; it is a haven that provides a cozy atmosphere where you can gather with your loved ones. Whether it's a casual hangout with friends or a family get-together, this place offers the perfect setting to create lasting memories. With its convenient location, friendly staff, and mouthwatering dishes, Misschu is undoubtedly a must-visit destination."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNYWN2iehgE_tELmdTCnmcPBYD3bgAymJiqvgbg""],""When"":""2023-8-23""},{""Name"":""Madeline Rose"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUDhF7Uk06rERfZjJ0mL9mr3s-i785g0yRNPOzJaB32jlxVYIP-uw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Bloody delicious 😋\nWill order from here again.\nOrdered Uber eats and price was good , food was yummy."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNBbir9Z5LHi4e60Wncwm_He726W0QH7dXK-81Z""],""When"":""2024-6-5""},{""Name"":""Black Mamba535"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLYR5s4kwgdwi28jpIJpiaRtkKxM-ivwzzHPM5ylT5eAiKMsA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great lunch place with plenty of vegetarian options.

Meats have great flavour - the aromatics around the meat are very fragrant and get extracted very well from the process of deep frying. Nice crispy bits at the top as well.\n\nComparing the ayam (chicken) vs bebek (duck) penyet, I would say there are parts on both that are a little too dry (but understandable given it’s the crisp and flavour they’re going for) but there are parts of the duck that have a nice fattiness running through it that helps keep the meat more moist and tender.

Batter on the fried squid was thin, perfectly seasoned and the squid had a great texture. Chilli vinaigrette added a nice pop and would order this dish again!\nThe large was a tall order and my friend and I were full after these 2 dishes 😂\n2. Brussel sprouts were incredibly roasted, where it had a smoky jacket that easily came off. This was fun to have and I'm a great fan of brussel sprouts being the means to get vegetables in my diet. 💚\n\n✔ Chilli crab dish had thicker pieces of spaghetti that helped to mop up the sauce. Presentation was fun and I appreciated that they already pulled out the \""lobster meat\"" already. This is hearty and great to enjoy as smaller portions.\nTiramisu was also a great way to finish! 🤗\n\nService was friendly and they kindly whipped up some bespoke mocktails for us. It was sweet and I love the surprise element behind it. 🍹\nI would happily come back again to The Hardware Club to try more of their dishes on offer!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPMf2Q5vGQy46l0_ezSbbCC0YsW7ZeIAEZ7sWKS""],""When"":""2024-6-3""},{""Name"":""Johnson Huynh"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL3KEFAPjSQ1GAtIZC9tQt2SLLct6DDUIx7CIkqkuwUn4DqSA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""Extremely disappointed with this food experience.

The flavour of the Italian sausage was underwhelming and quite bland, we also didn’t finish this dish.\n\nTo top it off the service was disappointing.

I got quite confused about where the entrance was and wandered around for a while. To get to the point, it was just okay. There were mistakes with my order, and the staff seemed busy, so it took a long time to order. However, the service got much better as the meal went on, so the initial mistakes didn't bother me too much. Also, you can find the menu by flipping over the illustration on the table. I spent some time figuring this out because the staff didn't mention it at first. They seem to want to give the restaurant a unique character, but they should explain things better to the customers.\n\nIt was the weekend, and I was dining alone, so I sat at the bar table. Here, it seems the head chef informs the staff when the food is ready in the kitchen. The chef's voice must get tired... Anyway, the kingfish was not bad. The cream on top was unique, and it balanced well with the distinctive sauce. You probably don't need to order the oysters. I was looking forward to the pork knuckle dish... but I should have ordered something else. They served fried pork knuckle (similar to the German dish Schweinshaxe), and it was tough to cut. It would have been better if it had been pre-sliced in the kitchen. The dish is meant to be eaten like Peking duck, with thin pancakes and vegetables, but it was too different from what I expected, and I didn't enjoy it.\n\nThe apple kimchi pancake consisted of kimchi made from shredded apple and a thin pancake. The texture and sweetness of the apple weren't bad, but it lacked the distinctive tanginess of kimchi, which was disappointing. The hoisin sauce was too ordinary. It would have been better with both hoisin and chili sauce. Throughout the meal, I kept thinking the food just lacked flavor. Not that it was bad, but it didn't taste like much. It would be better to order dumplings, buns, and a small main dish instead. The dessert was delicious, though. As for whether I'll go back... I'm not sure; I'll have to think about it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPDh2feqHGh3WL7wJn9pYazp0hREHi5T3VMopxY""],""When"":""2024-5-26""},{""Name"":""Alain Ludva"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKLM5tFYtY4l8uUOMCEMwBbGVrWoLKwXXuG7XztvAeIsmYKTA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""What an incredible evening!

It didn’t start well. We had made a booking in advance for a special night, which was mentioned in the booking, but the host thought it was fine to seat us at the bar table along with others. This was very disappointing. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, he told us that we would have to wait another 45 minutes to get a table. At that point, I decided to go to another restaurant. He then suggested taking us upstairs, though he mentioned we might not like the place.\n\nHowever, when we went upstairs, it was a totally different vibe. It was classy and quiet, unlike downstairs, which had a very basic and noisy atmosphere. I can’t help but wonder why he didn’t put us there in the first place, thinking the bar table was suitable for celebrating a special night.\n\nThings changed for the better once we were seated at the table. The server was extremely friendly and informative, genuinely showing compassion and care about making our night the best it could be. She checked on us frequently and had friendly chats with us. The food was simply delicious. We chose the 6-course chef special, and it was worth it. Every item had a beautiful presentation and was filled with flavors. The cocktails were delicious too. The vibe was perfect, with beautiful lights and atmosphere.\n\nI would have given 1 star, but thanks to the server and the food, I’m giving 3 stars. The team needs to reflect on why we were treated like that initially. It could have been the perfect night for us, but the initial sourness lingered throughout the evening and was the only topic we discussed at the table."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNFNZ0xyDlqKtUiIeAGfjsn01EpEQ77ByhcEdDH""],""When"":""2024-6-15""},{""Name"":""Pete Sanders"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVEw32AVd1aLlWSP-hWvYCuWTbuwFSAbFRFQHKmz_7zyTe_6XkoQg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Cumulus never disappoints and is a definite ‘go to’ in Melbourne.

I realized it was a mistake, not just with the menu but also with the restaurant choice. I have no intention of revisiting, and here’s why\n\n1. Noise like eating in the middle of a market\n\n- I couldn’t even understand what the other person was saying, let alone hear the explanations of the food. It felt like eating in the midst of a crowded Victoria Market.\n\n2. Terrible service\n\n- First, I ordered a drink, and without a word or explanation, a bewildered staff member just left a can at my table. I tried to understand it might be because they were busy. Then, it took 20 minutes between clearing my plate and waiting for the next dish. Staff repeatedly passed by my table ignoring the empty plates. Meanwhile, they kept checking on other tables about their food but didn’t say a word to me. Was I just supposed to eat whatever was given? The main dish and side dishes were supposed to be served together, but I received the main dish and one side. The staff said they would bring the other side dish soon. I waited patiently, and it arrived almost at the end of my meal. Even when I wanted to pay, I had to wait 15-20 minutes more because the staff were chatting with each other. The restaurant wasn’t even full. What’s the problem here? Even the chefs seemed out of it...\n\n3. Poor seasoning of the food\n\n- The menu itself wasn’t bad, and the ingredients were fine. But the food was just salty. So salty that I kept looking for water. But then the main dish, lamb shoulder, was completely bland... How am I supposed to adjust to these flavors?\n\nI dined alone, and the total cost was about $130. This was the worst restaurant experience I’ve had in Melbourne, and I don’t plan on returning. I’d rather get a sandwich and coffee from the cafe next door. it would be much more worthwhile.\n\nAnd now that I think about it, I have no idea what I was supposed to do with the radish and miso sauce. Was I supposed to spread it on the bread, or just dip the radish in the sauce and eat it? Thinking back, they didn’t explain anything."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNvFztRgup-z-e0-r8i40O-H076XiEEpf4HIqVr""],""When"":""2024-5-26""},{""Name"":""Foodie Files Melbourne"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWM5uVXT4DD1mNnhzCgfM7R2bueoDXnFhZpq01MdYcQrWvBRkUI=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""It’s been about 6 years since I’ve dined at Cumulus and after today’s lunch I’m asking myself why.

When all its ingredients were thoroughly mixed together, the dish was flavourful (in a way that was seemingly even more so than typical Pad Thai) and moist to the taste. The chicken baos consisted of a piece of well-marinated chicken wrapped in a soft white lotus steamed bun, topped with kimchi and mayo for taste. The vegetarian spring rolls were prepared in the classic Vietnamese deep fried style, and were a delightful appetiser. Together with one non-alcoholic drink, we paid a total of AUD 60.50, which was a considerably reasonable price for the excellent quality of food.\n\nLocated just on the outskirts of Melbourne's Chinatown, Hochi Mama is popular with both locals and tourists alike. On a random weekday night, we had to wait almost 40mins for a table for two as we did not make a prior reservation. Service standards were high; the waitress was friendly and hospitable throughout, and took the time to introduce the popular menu items to us.\n\nOverall, it was an excellent dining experience and well worth the (long) wait!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOfxWIUjNBbtHhHNC9QLa-NPGy3xbDY_bKoGuPj""],""When"":""2024-6-26""},{""Name"":""C \u0026 M Fraresso"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJpnT2EKxAAYxch2owwKxaz4GM-miTQgozCpIAIGJDE1yI5Gg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Had a great experience at Hochi Mama and will certainly be going back.

2024] Highlight was hands down the fantastic service. Marc was warm and jovial. Very friendly and helpful throughout with a great sense of humour. Made the evening wonderful. The place had a nice cosy feeling, but the table space was cramped.\n\nThe food was good. The bouillabaisse was rich and flavourful and the toasted bread complemented the dish well, allowing the diner to alternate between crispy bites and using it to soak up the soup. It could do with a touch less salt, but that's my personal preference. The veal schnitzel was done well.  The potato gnocchi was on the firm, chewy side though. The wines (by the glass) that were recommended paired well with the food.

Additionally, I would suggest skipping the banquet option, as you can enjoy a greater variety by selecting individual dishes for the same price. The vine leaves dish was average.

Turning to the main dishes, the most decent ones was the fried rice, the duck meat is cooked well, but the sauce is too salty, while the sauce for the barramundi was a bland combination of cream and chili oil while the fish is not seasoned well to paired the sauce off.

The starters were a delightful introduction to the meal, setting high expectations for what was to come.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was the lamb shoulder, which was incredibly juicy and flavorful. It was cooked to perfection and left us wanting more. Additionally, I ordered grilled prawns as an extra dish, and they were simply delicious.

(As wanted it to be a surprise) Waiter said he’d ask the kitchen. Waiter then came back to the table and whispered in my wife’s ear in front of my family. Naturally all were curious as to what was going on so my wife had to explain that she had asked for a candle or message, but the response had been that they were too busy. Following this the waiter charged us for the wrong table (overcharge of $200 and we learnt you are unable to pay without giving a minimum of 5% tip) He was very remorseful but it was a shame we had to have those experiences.

The meals came out quick and timely in their respective courses and were fresh and delicious, and the cocktails and cocktail menu was great! A standout for us was definitely the fried cauliflower which was served with the main of chicken, which we unfortunately found a little dry and lacking flavour. Overall this banquet option was definitely worth the price in comparison to other restaurants and we left very full and satisfied.\nOur only complaint was our waiter, who unfortunately was quite abrupt and passive aggressive to us which was unusual considering all the other staff were lovely.\nOverall so glad we returned, the banquet was totally worth the cost and made it an easy night and will definitely be returning again in the future!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOwQqWCgEnDAfkYvz4yed8cYwF4e-khy1QpSJNr""],""When"":""2024-2-10""},{""Name"":""Manufit326"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJMmHZetnpskOZr9GbLYg_vXFlyqFmnXDSsd0o_QNbHvIyf5bw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It’s becoming our favourite restaurant, starting because the place is perfectly decorated with a warm welcome.

The strong flavour makes it a great dish to pair with rice.\n\n“Xu Xiang” Eggplant with pork mince and sweet sour sauce - Eggplants are cooked through and nice and soft. Sauce was delicious. If you are someone who likes eggplant in sauce, this is another flavoursome dish to pair with rice.\n\nSpicy lamb ribs with capsicum, onions, peanuts, coriander, cumin and paprika - Amazing aroma and flavour. The lamb ribs were simply a delight and cooked to perfection. This dish is perfect to enjoy on its own or pair with rice.\n\nThey also served a small plate of picked cabbage as complimentary appetiser, which was really nice. Overall the dining experience was enjoyable. Staff were attentive although we sat at the outdoor dining area. Prices are on the expensive side. Highly recommend using Liven to buy Foodollars to get discount if you can.\n\nOther photos feature dishes from a previous visit."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPybdTMprTn7seyk0pSTVI3YOCLNkQHLQG7Ab2r""],""When"":""2022-11-19""}]",

The first thing I felt was how friendly the staff were, the food choices were simple and when my steak sandwich came out it was so tasty! The window bench seats are a perfect place to sit out of the way and people watch.

Additionally, the Octopus I ordered was divine, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor.\n\nNot to be overlooked, the dessert was a highlight of our dining experience. The Hazelnut dessert paired with ice cream was an absolute delight, offering a sublime ending to our meal. Our friend enjoyed the Lamb Cutlet, which was equally praised for its flavors and preparation.\n\nWe were also pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful kids' meal options. It's rare to find  that caters so effectively to children without compromising on quality. Even the Fish and Chips from the kids' menu proved to be an excellent choice, showcasing their commitment to excellence across all dishes.\n\nWhile my photos may not capture the full splendor of our meals, I cannot recommend Cafe Sydney enough.

The homely cakes and homemade delights on the menu also looked inviting, making it more than just a cafe. However, the service was a tad tardy, and the staff behind the counter didn’t engage with customers at the bar seating area, which was a bit disappointing.

Came here for breakfast with my wife during our stay in Sydney after reading generally positive reviews and it's an understatement to say we came away very disappointed and ripped off. We ordered the French toast and the \""special\"" vanilla porridge together with two long black coffees.\n\nCoffee was one of the worst coffees I've ever tried. I make coffee at home myself and my coffee tastes a thousand times better than what we were given. It had so much astringent taste, it was disgusting. Do you guys actually taste what you are making?\n\nThe special vanilla porridge is a downright rip off. If you are going to call it a special and charge 17 dollars for it, you really need to make it special. Instead it was just a cheap rolled oat you can buy at woolies for $1.40 for 750g bag cooked in milk with tiny amount of fruit on top. 17 dollars for that? You've got to be kidding me. See the photo for yourself and decide for yourself whether that's worth 17 dollars.\n\nFrench toast was slightly better but nothing to write home about either. The bread tasted average at best.\n\nLastly, charging customers 30 cents plus 1.9% order fee for the inconvenience of having to order food through their website is a joke. You have to even put in your personal details like name, phone number and email address to be able to put in the order. So you are charging customers for doing the job your employees should be doing? On top of that, Google pay option doesn't even work for some reason so we were forced to use the credit card option which once again comes with additional fees on top.\n\nIf you are reading this, I would steer well clear from this establishment. There are tons of better options out there. Should have just gone to Joe Black Coffee where we had fabulous breakfast a few days ago."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPRtUAt1AhvpjlzjxIB8obv3z35ulLR-NksxUUI""],""When"":""2024-2-11""},{""Name"":""L N"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK_x0jhMpHDzeVBirF0fxLRLIiwfUa3JFQKGDkh8FZCNVbNfn8=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great cafe, food was great, the owner was also there and he made sure I was happy with my order.

But the restaurant being waterfront does give a really nice atmosphere and the service was pretty good.\n\nAlso, if you stay at the Sheraton, it’s only a couple minutes walk from there!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM7En_OectZ26T0PDFQDNokGHLFzOHcojKp_ICO""],""When"":""2023-10-14""},{""Name"":""Jason Butterworth"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLZ-cPlXAQZy6V7ROoBtMpMRcZP21Xbzye26picm_QcEYaj=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Beautiful spot on the marina.

Despite my attempt to gracefully address the issue with the lady in her late 30s or early 40s of Middle Eastern or Indian descent, the reaction was less than amiable.

We go on a weekly basis before a movie or after a UFC fight. We have Star platinum, gold and bronze members in our family. Staff have been mostly friendly and accommodating, except when I was told it would cost a dollar when I asked for basic hot sauce, and we had just paid for a large meal (we usually go with 4 to 6 people). What a bunch of penny pinching nonsense.\n\nHere's what we found has been good:\n\nSpicy Buffalo crispy fried wings \u0026 blue cheese dip are on point, we have 2 Americans in our family and you guys have got this down to a T, so keep it up!\n\nThe pumpkin salad and caesar salad are winners!\n\nThe Singapore style Lobster special with fried rice was delicious, can you please do more of this dish as it is underrated.\n\nThe meat lovers pizza, supreme pizza, chicken parmesan, chicken schnitzel with gravy, corned beef special, chicken burger, spring rolls, butter chicken, pumpkin soup, onion rings, wedges and roast beef plate have all been very good.\n\nThe vanilla slices and other cakes have all been great. No complaints.\n\nWhat's been mediocre and inconsistent:\n\nThe calamari was good one time and overcooked, almost burnt another time. Same with the t-bone steak and the beef burger. Also one time you had horseradish, another time you did not. Some consistency would be nice.\n\nWhat's been a disappointment:\n\nThe steak and bugs special was bad, nothing good to say about it but bland, dry, and overcooked, some steak sauce and garlic butter would've been nice. The side salads that come with a meal are tiny and barely have any dressing on them and are mostly tasteless (perhaps offer other dressings too for some variety), they're more like a garnish than anything. The lobster mornay special was overcooked and pretty awful, we left still hungry. The roast lamb special was tough, overcooked and barely had any gravy on it and was super bland. Don't ever skimp on gravy with the roast dinner plates!! May I suggest adding herbs, garlic \u0026 olive oil to the vegetables? Or at least lemon pepper seasoning or something. It's like eating cubes of water."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN3JliQmYEtyif1TuiRqZlKzHimB8Jb5Wu20_Qh""],""When"":""2022-5-8""},{""Name"":""Lisa Kingsbeer"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXr7ekLIkMC-MoJWRXRCgcbBE5wY0ydLQN45kx1NdUJy4vJh0o_=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""A family lunch at Food Quarter was a pleasant surprise.

The oysters are the smallest  I have ever seen. The meat was slightly bigger than a 5c piece. It’s an embarrassment that they served these. I guess they are purchased as they are rejected by every other restaurant. They were fresh though, but you could barely taste them due to the minuscule size. I think there should be a few bowls with dressings to go with the oysters. Kilpatrick oysters are served also at the carvery, but also teeny tiny. The Crab legs were froze and watery. The scallops were large and plump, but were not replenished fast enough. They were served with a tarty dressing with fish roe, I believe. Often there were empty platters. When we first arrived, there was a whole fish looking dish, which had already been eaten. This was not replaced at all. Instead there were two platters of the same dish. Hey also bought out a second mussels dish instead of the scallops. I asked if there were scallops on the buffet, I got told yes. I asked where, and the lad said did I check the salad side. Yes I did, there were no scallops. I then asked the staff to bring some out, but customers should not have to. At this time two of the platters were empty, the soft cheese was empty and not replaced quickly either. The prawns were king prawns, not tiger which was a nice surprise. These were on the small size too, but acceptable. The bugs were also on the small side. The crabs too were small, and you could barely get any meat out, as again they were not very fresh or again frozen.\nSalads were uninspiring, and not many people ate those, similar to the hot food. There was a pasta made in a cheese wheel which was very nice, as was the chicken roll.\nThe desserts were very very pretty, but they were all similar with a mousse type cake with a different flavour.\nBreakfast buffet was a let down, for $52, I was expecting it all. There was so smoked salmon, no prosciutto, no avocado. None of the high priced items you expect at $52. The star has all of these. A whole side of the buffet is for fruity. You don’t need 9 different plates of fruit, you can condense this and put on a platter, but it seems they just needed to fill the space. None of the fruits are exotic either, which should be expected on the GC and at $52. Buy some dragon or star fruit which is currently in season. No one seemed interested in the wilted salad and vegetables in oil. It is advertised as table service omelette, but this wasn’t offered to us. What they did well was the sweets, but again, not the same as on the menu online. The sweets were the best of any buffet I have had, as were the juices. The orange juice seemed real, with pith, whereas the star seems to have watered down juice. The trail mix and macadamia, was a small nod to local produce. There was a small gluten free area too, which seemed to be better than other hotel buffets. Coffee was included , which was great. The girls working today were very busy."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOEv63sjFf0hl1r1MaiuXGuseEqbtYhtLfV3ufY""],""When"":""2024-3-10""},{""Name"":""Enyi"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW-Tl-GeRIyDQUvRtgLxfCCH76Sja8WJcB2J1afgeVuJrUhh_g=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Luxury hotel dining setting.

Tea, coffee and hot choc are not. Hot choc is really good! This could have been a 5 star rating if not for the watery crab legs and briney prawns.

The wide open doors and rustic interior with homemade jars of pickles, fresh produce in wooden crates, cakes, breads and olive oil in longneck beer bottles, all help set the mood, and that mood is - relax, take a deep breath and enjoy something special.\nThe staff here were exceptionally friendly and care about their food, which comes across in their enthusiastic approach.\n\nI started with a Bloody Mary that was garnished with in-house, homemade pickles, fresh cracked pepper and a fresh lemon wedge, excellent! My only misdemeanour, I forgot to ask for it 'extra' spicy.\nA green juice for my 'partner in dine' (sorry) Both 'green and red juices'' were quality and freshly made.\n\nWe ordered the Spring Waffle and the Pickleman's Platter - with the latter being basically a deconstructed, albeit, hearty sandwich.\nBoth plates were quickly and wholly demolished with almost no conversion between us, yes, that good.\nMy only gripe, the whites on my poached egg, on my waffle, was a little \""snotty.\"" (undercooked) luckily I like a runny yolk, so this didn't deter me in the least, but may bother others.\nWeekends here can be a very busy affair, so midweek lunch is where it's at for a no fuss experience.\nThe carrot and walnut cake is a must buy. A generous serve, sinfully moist, with crunchy walnuts and super fresh with no fridge smell/taste.\n\nVarious homemade pickles, chilli sauces, chutneys and olive oil are available to purchase, so be sure to load up, if that's your thing.\n\nAll in all, one of the best cafes in Adelaide.\n\nHighly recommended."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM9AmfDRNcYK3XAjoJQ0XJh9JkYuhI3v_JrEQGV""],""When"":""2024-3-1""},{""Name"":""Chrissy Masters"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL8s5wEaFAjA2_hJgdpQgz--DfDaShYB2VWletqPGUwiuar2Q=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""This place is sensational.

If you have never been to a Jewish Deli, this would be a great place to go to experience that, and we would consider it a destination spot. It is located on a quiet street in North Adelaide, with plenty of seating outdoors and inside buzzes with a tradition deli feel.\n\n(Note: We only review a spot after two visits to be fair on judgement) The service has always been friendly and accommodating. However when they are busy the service level is the same, but be prepared for a delay on food coming out of the kitchen which would be expected.  Our first  visit the food came out quickly was to a very high standard. A huge bonus for the fact they make their own bagels in house each day. (Which you can buy to take away when not sold out.) The menu does blend traditional jewish food with their own inventive twist.\n\nThe baked eggs were perfect and full of flavour. I you have never had a Reuben you must go to this place. The bagels very much reminded us of New York style bagels, and we loved the bagel and smoked salmon. We would rate it as a 4.5, due to some of the delays in food, but still an amazing place and a 5 is not that far of a stretch."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPNTqGplabG2pso3gHUl-LItzND9q8oQU1asuLw""],""When"":""2023-12-3""}]",

Despite all of the high-end reviews of Mr. Sunshine and being included on lists of “Places to eat”.  We stumbled upon this café, as the highest rated breakfast restaurant in the area.  We were not sure driving over to it as it is in an industrial, in a tucked away area.  But once we got there, boy were we surprised at what we found.\n\nWe found a very cozy, welcoming fun atmosphere.  If you go here, you will know what we mean.  Plenty of seating outside in a covered, enclosed area.  If you are chilly out there, they even have homemade blankets you can pull over your shoulders.  Inside, we felt like we were at home, but if our home was retro.  It was such a comfortable spot to be in.  It had a retro feel, a lot of buzz, with music playing on a record player.  Just a joy to see.\n\nAdd, on to that no matter how busy they are (which has been both times we have been there), they are all very attentive, and give amazing service.  We never make reservations, but they have always quickly found ways to accommodate us.\n\nNow the food takes this spot to a whole new level.  The flavours mix in what you would expect with a traditional brunch, but they add in the amazing flavours of areas like the middle east.  Every dish is executed very well, which would seem surprising based on how busy the kitchen it, but it has been consistently great. We would recommend the shakshuka eggs, the french toast and “El Capitan” breakfast.\n\nOverall, high recommendations for Mr. Sunshine.  We can confidently say they will not disappoint but will surprise you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNFjg4an2SWfEuXesO-cwKzVcNZiKCqRR8p6I6I""],""When"":""2023-11-25""},{""Name"":""Daryl Gilbert"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWdZkV-O369rhNr_BqpUfg9TS9FuYJOoKgzhQuxKsjuWdYL6kdx=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Just like Nonna's house.

Enjoyed the different egg brunches, with generous toppings of salmon or bacon or other options. Good presentation of food! Returned to try a lunch option, Ocean trout in potatoes. It was flavourful and melts in the mouth. Salad was a tad too sour for me, which overpowered the fresh taste of the rocket leaves.\n\nCoffee aroma is awesome! Perks you right up and the latte art is superb (see the dragon!). Chai latte is no longer as good, in fact tasted more dilute this time. Dessert disappointment is the caramel cake slice, which had a hard slab of chocolate on top. Could be better if it was easier to slice through. Came back again to try the fresh lime tart, which was average. Tart casing wasn't crumbly nor light, quite hard to cut through with the fork.

My mother had a toasted cheese sandwich which was bland, virtually no cheese and ham, definitely not fresh. My wife had the smoked salmon which was also poor. I complained to the manager who was a bald headed old guy. He was incredibly grumpy and basically told us bad luck, that's what it is - no refund or replacement. Worst customer service I ever had.

I had an iced almond latte and enjoyed this brew .\nGluten free options are not particularly wide , but I did have a Reuben sandwich with a twist , ( with kimchi and gochujang mayo ) and was pleasantly surprised by the gluten free bread , which was thick and seeded - delicious.\nWorth a visit, especially if you visit the Central Market."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMPnB9ns7T7w5ZZjWEpQ7_oX3BZYOEs3QVpBksW""],""When"":""2024-1-25""},{""Name"":""Alyssa"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBV3il-cZ7BDyjglaxQgEDuq-ONcgZOm1AwM97g6j5UYKN_MoZ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Got a take away breakfast from this cafe.

When we arrived no one greeted us or even made eye contact, and we were unclear if it was table service or not. We were looking for a menu, but could only find a blackboard inside with some food listed but no prices. When I ask a staff member if I could see a paper menu with the prices, she said they don’t have any - but she could talk me through the price of each of the menu items if I wished. Really? We bought a couple of coffees, and they were ok, but the atmosphere and overall interaction here was super uncomfortable, so we passed on the food and went elsewhere to eat."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",
